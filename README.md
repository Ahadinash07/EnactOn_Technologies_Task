## 🎯 Core Features

### API Integration & Data Display
- **PokéAPI Integration**: Complete integration with PokéAPI for fetching Pokémon data
- **Global Search**: Debounced search functionality with 300ms delay to prevent excessive API calls
- **Type Filtering**: Filter Pokémon by their types (Fire, Water, Grass, etc.)
- **Grid Layout**: Responsive card-based layout displaying Pokémon with images and key information
- **Detail View**: Rich detail modal with comprehensive Pokémon information including stats, abilities, and artwork

### Navigation & Performance
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Implemented using react-window for efficient rendering of large lists
- **Infinite Scroll**: Smooth infinite scrolling with IntersectionObserver API
- **Request Optimization**: API response caching and request cancellation to prevent race conditions
- **Loading States**: Proper skeleton loading states and error handling

### User Features
- **Favorites System**: Add/remove Pokémon to favorites with localStorage persistence
- **Favorites Management**: Dedicated favorites view with bulk removal capability
- **Multiple Sort Options**: Sort by ID, name, height, or weight
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout optimized for all device sizes

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### State Management
**Choice: Context API with useReducer**

**Reasoning**: 
- Context API provides sufficient state management for this application size
- useReducer offers predictable state updates and better debugging
- Avoids Redux overhead while maintaining clean separation of concerns
- Custom hooks encapsulate business logic and promote reusability

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### Implemented Strategies
1. **Debounced Search**: 300ms debounce prevents excessive API calls during typing
2. **Request Cancellation**: AbortController cancels stale API requests to prevent race conditions
3. **Virtual Scrolling**: react-window efficiently renders only visible items in large lists
4. **API Response Caching**: In-memory cache reduces redundant API calls
5. **Loading Skeletons**: Immediate feedback while data loads
6. **Image Lazy Loading**: Browser-native lazy loading for Pokémon images
7. **Memoization**: React.memo and useCallback optimize re-renders

### Performance Constraints Met
- Debounced search input (300ms)
- Request cancellation for stale API calls
- List virtualization for large datasets
- Proper loading skeletons/placeholders

## User Experience Features

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure with proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible
- High contrast color schemes

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific layouts
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Optimized for devices from 320px to 1920px+

## Architecture Decisions

### State Management Choice
**Selected**: Context API + useReducer over Redux Toolkit

**Justification**:
- Application complexity doesn't warrant Redux overhead
- Context API provides sufficient global state management
- useReducer offers predictable state updates
- Easier to test and maintain for this scope

### Pagination Strategy
**Selected**: Infinite Scroll + Virtual Scrolling

**Justification**:
- Better user experience for discovery-focused application
- Virtual scrolling handles performance at scale
- Eliminates pagination UI complexity
- More engaging for mobile users

### API Choice
**Selected**: PokéAPI

**Justification**:
- Rich, well-documented dataset
- Reliable uptime and performance
- Comprehensive Pokémon information
- Good image assets and artwork

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
1. **Advanced Filtering**: Multiple simultaneous filters, stat ranges, generation filtering
2. **Comparison Tool**: Side-by-side Pokémon comparison with stat visualizations
3. **Team Builder**: Create and save custom Pokémon teams with battle calculations

### Technical Improvements
- Service Worker implementation for offline functionality
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Advanced caching with IndexedDB for persistent storage

## 🛠️ Development Notes

### Environment Setup
- Next.js 13+ with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for component library
- Jest + React Testing Library for testing

### API Integration
- All API calls go through centralized service layer
- Comprehensive error handling and loading states
- Request deduplication and caching mechanisms
- Type-safe API responses with TypeScript interfaces
